Keep changes small and coherent. Prefer explicit types in GDScript to avoid Variant inference (warnings may be treated as errors).

Documentation rule:
- Keep `CONTEXT.md` as the single source of truth entry point. When behavior/structure changes, update `CONTEXT.md` and any linked docs in `docs/` so everything is discoverable.

Documentation workflow:
- When you make changes to the project:
  - Update `CONTEXT.md` first (what changed + where).
  - If needed, update the linked deeper docs in `docs/` (structure, testing, known issues).
  - Keep `CONTEXT.md` short, but make it a reliable navigation map.

Project entry points:
- Startup: scenes/MainMenu.tscn
- Roll simulation: scenes/Main.tscn
- Stat simulation: scenes/Simulation.tscn
- Many roll simulation: scenes/ManyRollSimulation.tscn

Dice contract (all dice scenes):
- func roll() -> void
- signal rolled(value: int)

Dice visuals:
- Each dice Body has an Edges MeshInstance3D (black wire edges).
- Outline exists but is optional (outline_enabled defaults false).

Testing:
- Headless tests: tests/run_tests.gd

Operational:
- Do not run git commands unless the user explicitly requests them.
